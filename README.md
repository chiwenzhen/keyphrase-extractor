# keyphrase-extractor
(Jul, 2012) a new feature called "global reoccurrence measure" to extract keyphrase from a document

# notes
It is a Visual C++ 6.0 project. But it is ugly code just for verify my paper method. 
It is highly recommended not to compile and run the code yourself, many failure may encounter!!!
